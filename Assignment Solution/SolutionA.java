/*
* The array of integers has the following properties:
    1. With a known length N
    2. The array is sorted in an ascending order
    3. The array holds distinct integers (i.e. there are no repeating numbers)
    4. The array is 1-indexed, i.e. the first element is stored in A[1] (not A[0])

Find the first positive integer M (where 1 <= M <= N) such that when M is used as the array index, the result from the array is the the integer M itself. i.e. A[M] = M
In other words, find the first positive integer M where M is both a userâ€™s ID and its index in the array of user ids.
Write a program to find M, if it exists, in O(log N) time. If M does not exist, please return NOT_FOUND

Please note that the code takes two inputs:
    1. First one being the size of the array
    2. Second one being the elements inside the array

So, to input an array having 5 elements, the first input will be 5 and the next 5 inputs will be the elements of the array.
